            <p><b>WELCOME. YOU ARE ACCESSING THE NTDGAMES ROOT PAGE.</b></p>
            <p>I am the creator of NTDGAMES. This is a personal project where I am starting my game development journey. I don't claim to be a professional developer, but rather an individual who is learning and passionate about creating digital experiences.</p>

            <p><b>CURRENT OBJECTIVE: LEARNING AND EXPERIMENTATION.</b></p>
            <p>I am currently focused on creating simple games to master the fundamental skills. Every project you see here is an initial step, aimed at gaining experience. As my skills and expertise grow, I will move on to building larger and more complex titles.</p>
            
            <p><b>[SYSTEM STATUS: BUILDING GAME DATA]</b></p>
